# Angular-with-Google-Maps

1. API Key Setup: 

I configured and secured my applications by obtaining API keys from the Google Cloud Console. This step ensured that my applications could access the Google Maps API securely. 

2. Embedding Maps: 

I integrated Google Maps into Angular components, allowing for the seamless embedding of maps within the application. This involved configuring the Maps JavaScript API and utilizing Angular's native integration capabilities. 

3. Markers and Infowindows: 

I implemented custom markers and infowindows on the map, enhancing the user experience by providing interactive and informative elements based on the location data 

4. Zoom In and Zoom Out Functionality: 

Zoom In: 

Google Maps Controls: Google Maps provides default controls for zooming in and out. 
Zoom Control: Users can use the zoom control buttons on the map interface to zoom in. 
Zoom Out: 

Google Maps Controls: Similar to zooming in, users can use the zoom control buttons or the mouse scroll wheel to zoom out. 
 
 
5. Conversion to Different Image Formats: 

SVG Format: 

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): SVG is an XML-based vector image format. 
Conversion: Google Maps can be converted to SVG using html2image library that support the SVG format. 
 
JPG and JPEG Formats: 

Conversion: Google Maps screenshots can be saved or exported as JPG or JPEG files using html2image library 
 

 

6. Manual Addition of Markers: 

Coordinates: 

Coordinates: Manually input the latitude and longitude coordinates to specify marker locations. 
API Usage: Use the Google Maps API to programmatically add markers at specific coordinates. 
 

Custom-Made Markers: 

Custom Icons: Create custom marker icons for a personalized touch. 
Marker Options: Customize marker options, including icon.. 
 

 

Chat GPT Integration 
In addition to mastering Angular concepts and integrating Google Maps API, I further enriched my learning journey by seamlessly incorporating the ChatGPT API into Angular applications. This integration brought a conversational element to the user experience, allowing users to interact with the application using . When prompted for location coordinates, the ChatGPT API processed the input, and the application dynamically marked the corresponding location on the Google Map. This not only enhanced the overall user interaction but also introduced asynchronous communication patterns, enabling real-time updates based on user input.
